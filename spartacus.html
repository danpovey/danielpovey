<center>	      <h3>I AM SPARTACUS</h3> </center>


I would like to start a trend.

<p>

Everyone who wants to show that they are against the social-justice madness,
please order for yourself an I AM SPARTACUS t-shirt.   You can find many
online.  I have just ordered 3.

<p>

I AM SPARTACUS is a reference to
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q>this scene</a> in
the 1960 film "Spartacus".  Spartacus was the leader of a slave
rebellion in the Roman empire that was successful for a short time,
but which the Roman army eventually crushed.  In the movie, the army
commander tells the rebel slaves that they can live as long as they
give up Spartacus.  To obscure the identity of the real Spartacus,
other slaves stand up and say &ldquo;I AM SPARTACUS&rdquo;.  Of course, they are
all killed.
<p>
The reason why it's relevant is that if you stand up to the social-justice
movement you will likely suffer severe consequences, just like the men who
claimed to be Spartacus did.
<p>
To be truly worthy of wearing an I AM SPARTACUS t-shirt, you must
commit that if you are told that wearing an I AM SPARTACUS t-shirt
is against the policy of your work or school, you will wear it just as much as
before.  That is the I AM SPARTACUS promise, and it is the bond
that links all the members of the I AM SPARTACUS movement.
<p>
In the movie all the spartacuses are very similar-looking white males,
but that is not what the I AM SPARTACUS movement is about.  It is
about standing up to the social-justice madness and asking for
an equal playing field for everyone; and it's about standing up against
witch hunts and lies, and caring about the truth.  
The I AM SPARTACUS movement is open to
everyone; that is important.
<p>
Please feel free to create I AM SPARTACUS web-pages, local groups and products.
I am only the first one, but I hope that others will stand up and say,
like me, <br>
