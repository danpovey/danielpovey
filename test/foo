If anyone is interested in  working with me on any of these ideas, please let me know.<div><h3><a name="TOC-Kaldi-speech-recognition-toolkit-"></a>Kaldi (speech recognition toolkit)</h3><div>"I don't always use speech recognition software, but when I do, I prefer Kaldi."</div><div>See <a href="http://kaldi.sf.net" rel="nofollow">http://kaldi.sf.net</a> for more details.</div><div>I am currently working on getting Tomas Mikolov's RNNLMs working with Kaldi.</div><div>Other TODO items include: get the fMPE/fMMI code working; add speech/silence segmentation.  These will probably get done within the next few months.  In the medium term I'd also like to add "genone style" models, subspace fMLLR (as in my papers with Kaisheng Yao), and add some improvements to SGMMs.  Others are working on neural-net based systems. </div><h3><a name="TOC-Acoustic-Modeling"></a>Acoustic Modeling</h3><h4><a name="TOC-SGMMs-Subspace-Gaussian-Mixture-Models-"></a>SGMMs (Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models)</h4><div>See <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dpovey/my-publications">My Publications</a> for more details.  An immediate (not-too-ambitious) goal with SGMMs is to implement a new version in Kaldi with a few new features: I want to add the previously published speaker-dependent weights part ("symmetric SGMM"), and also add something new: the capability to have a kind of two-level hierarchy of Gaussians where the covariance matrices and the projection matrices M and N are shared at the top level of the hierarchy and the bottom level only has mean offsets, and the weight projection vectors w.  This should enable better models with less training data.</div></div><div>In the medium term I'd like to do a "predictive" version of SGMMs.  Explained very coarsely, this involves predicting the next frame from the previous few frames.  Note: this is not just an auto-regressive HMM (I know, those don't work).  And I have previously done some preliminary experiments in this direction which showed a small improvement, which I think could be turned into a large one.  The basic idea is, when using features of the spliced-cepstra + LDA type, to predict the later spliced cepstra from the earlier ones, but the predictive model is synthesized from the GMM, using p(last frames | first frames) = p(last frames, first frames) / p(first frames), where the numerator is the regular GMM likelihood and the denominator is the same GMM likelihood after projecting to a reduced dimension.  Believe it or not, this type of model does work.  But I'm not sure whether it will really give "worthwhile" improvements.</div><div>I am also interested in stuff with SGMMs where you handle the phonetic context in a more clever way (Brian Mak is working in this direction too, and I have started some work with Thang Vu using Kaldi).</div><div><br /></div><h4><a name="TOC-Pronunciation-and-stress-modeling"></a>Pronunciation and stress modeling</h4><div>Pronunciation and stress models are hard to automatically learn from data, but I think it's important enough that it deserves attention.  Examples: in English, the words "to" and "the" are pronounced in distinct ways depending on the next word.  So does cross-word pronunciation modeling make sense?  The machinery to rescore lattices with these types of models is already being built in Kaldi in order to support RNNLMs, so it's not that much extra work.  </div><div>Stress modeling-- is it possible to train and use context-dependent models of phonetic stress?  The general idea would probably be to start with a stress-marked dictionary and see if you can improve it somehow, but ideally you'd like to learn this stuff entirely from data.  Again, a lattice-rescoring framework would probably be the easiest way to do this.  I had in m
