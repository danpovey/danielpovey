<h2> How to set up computing cluster in the Amazon cloud<h2>

<h3> Purpose of this page </h3>

I wanted to set up a cluster of computers on Amazon to train some speech recognition
systems based on <a href=http://kaldi.sf.net>Kaldi</a>.  The Kaldi scripts are based
on GridEngine and assume all the nodes see the same shared file system (e.g. via NFS).
Basically I wanted to duplicate the setup that we have in the <a href=http://clsp.jhu.edu>Center for Language and Speech processing</a>.
I tried <a href=star.mit.edu/cluster/> StarCluster</a>, but I found that at the current time
it was not always completely robust, and I wanted more control than that software would give me.
(Basically, modifying that software is hard because you have to go deep inside Python scripts 
to change anything).

<p>
This page is intended to form a record of what I did, and help others to do the same.
Note that this assumes some knowledge of UNIX system administration, or at least the
willingness to learn.  If you want a pre-packaged tool, you had better go with StarCluster.
This page is for those who want to get down into the details.
