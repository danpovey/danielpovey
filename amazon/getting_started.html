<h3> Getting started with EC2 </h3>

<h3> Purpose of this page </h3>

I wanted to set up a cluster of computers on Amazon to train some speech recognition
systems based on <a href=http://kaldi.sf.net>Kaldi</a>.  The Kaldi scripts are based
on GridEngine and assume all the nodes see the same shared file system (e.g. via NFS).
Basically I wanted to duplicate the setup that we have in the <a href=http://clsp.jhu.edu>Center for Language and Speech processing</a>.
I tried <a href=star.mit.edu/cluster/> StarCluster</a>, but I found that at the current time
it was not always completely robust, and I wanted more control than that software would give me.
(Basically, modifying that software is hard because you have to go deep inside Python scripts 
to change anything).

This page is intended to form a record of what I did, and help others to do the same.
